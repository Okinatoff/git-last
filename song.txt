Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on yo face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
 
We will, we will rock you!
We will, we will rock you!
 
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world some day
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you!
We will, we will rock you!
 
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleadin'with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Somebody better put you back in your place
 
We will, we will rock you!
We will, we will rock you!

Don't Speak

You and me, we used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end
It looks as though you're lettin' go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Our memories, well, they can be inviting
But some are altogether mighty frightening
As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands, I sit and cry
